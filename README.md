# Cyclistic-Bikes-Analysis
My capstone project for the Data Analytics Certificate through Grow With Google.

This project is the culmination of my R Programming language studies while earning my certification. It uses public bike share data from the last twelve months 
(from the day of upload) for the City of Chicago. The data were made available by Divvy Bikes according to the principles of "Open Data". It is used to gather insights
for a fictional company named Cyclistic as part of the capstone scenario for my certification coursework.
